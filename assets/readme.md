### Explanation

1. **HTML**:

   - Added a search bar and buttons for searching and adding users.
   - The user form is hidden initially and shown only when the "Add New User" button is clicked.

2. **CSS**:

   - Styled the page to look clean and responsive.
   - Included styles for hiding and showing elements and general form styling.

3. **JavaScript**:

   - Handles the visibility of the user form and list.
   - Manages form submission to add new users to the list.
   - Implements search functionality to filter users based on name, date of birth, or place of birth.
   - Displays the list of users and shows detailed information in an alert when a user is clicked.

This approach will ensure that star ratings are visually appealing and consistent across different devices and browsers.

This setup ensures a clean separation between viewing users and adding a new user, with responsive design and interactive elements.
